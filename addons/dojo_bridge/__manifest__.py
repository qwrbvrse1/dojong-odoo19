    "description": """
Exposes a versioned, stateless REST API secured by HS256 JWTs issued by the
NestJS Control Plane. Handles multi-tenant DB routing, Firebase UID to
dojo.member identity resolution, and typed webhook ingestion.

All routes use auth=none. Odoo session auth is never involved.
The JWT issued by NestJS (after Firebase verification) is the sole gate.
